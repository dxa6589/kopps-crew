# KoppsVR
Interactive Music Experiences project

## Description
This project was created for display at imagineRIT 2022 as part of the VR Jukebox for the interdisciplinary class, Interactive Music Experiences IGME.518/PHAP.368. Our concept uses the song Virtual Reality by the band Kopps. The song is about our dependence on virtual spaces and relationships and their fragility so we wanted to represent that in our project by portraying the dissolution of a seemingly perfect concert experience by simulating glitches. 

### Set-up
1. Clone the repository
2. Connect your VR headset through [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/steamvr)
3. Run the project by creating a build or from the unity editor game window

### Usage
- Teleport by aiming with the teleport rays and clicking the primary 2D axis
- Interact with the band members to trigger audio glitches
- Interact with the audience and objects in the space to trigger even more glitches
